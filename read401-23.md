#  Hashtables

* Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

* A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.

* Since we are able to hash our key and determine the exact location where our value is stored

* Hash maps take advantage of an array’s O(1) read access.

* A hashtable traditionally is created from an array. 

* Each index of the array can hold many types of values.

* The trick is how the values are stored in comparison to efficiency. Each Index of the array contain “buckets”. Each of these “buckets” holds one key/value pair combination.

* When there is no entry in a specific bucket, the buckets (each index of the array) all start null. The hash table starts each bucket empty and overwrites their value once a key generates a hashCode that corresponds with an index.

* A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array.

Hash maps do this to store values:
* accept a key
* calculate the hash of the key
* use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
* store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list

Hash maps do this to read value:

* accept a key
* calculate the hash of the key
* use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
* use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
* search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given

## Hash function
A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

To achieve a good hashing mechanism, It is important to have a good hash function with the following basic requirements:

1. Easy to compute: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.

2. Uniform distribution: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.

3. Less collisions: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.

Here, it will take O(n) time (where n is the number of strings) to access a specific string. This shows that the hash function is not a good hash function.

Let’s try a different hash function. The index for a specific string will be equal to sum of ASCII values of characters multiplied by their respective order in the string after which it is modulo with 2069 (prime number).

String                                Hash function                               Index
abcdef       (971 + 982 + 993 + 1004 + 1015 + 1026)%2069       38
bcdefa       (981 + 992 + 1003 + 1014 + 1025 + 976)%2069       23
cdefab       (991 + 1002 + 1013 + 1024 + 975 + 986)%2069       14
defabc       (1001 + 1012 + 1023 + 974 + 985 + 996)%2069       11

A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched. By using a good hash function, hashing can work well. Under reasonable assumptions, the average time required to search for an element in a hash table is O(1).
