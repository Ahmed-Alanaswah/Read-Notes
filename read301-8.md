Most modern web applications expose APIs that clients can use to interact with the application. A well-designed web API should aim to support:

Platform independence. Any client should be able to call the API, regardless of how the API is implemented internally. This requires using standard protocols, and having a mechanism whereby the client and the web service can agree on the format of the data to exchange.

Service evolution. The web API should be able to evolve and add functionality independently from client applications. As the API evolves, existing client applications should continue to function without modification. All functionality should be discoverable so that client applications can fully use it.

This guidance describes issues that you should consider when designing a web API.

## What is REST?

In 2000, Roy Fielding proposed Representational State Transfer (REST) as an architectural approach to designing web services. REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP. However, most common REST API implementations use HTTP as the application protocol, and this guide focuses on designing REST APIs for HTTP.

A primary advantage of REST over HTTP is that it uses open standards, and does not bind the implementation of the API or the client applications to any specific implementation. For example, a REST web service could be written in ASP.NET, and client applications can use any language or toolset that can generate HTTP requests and parse HTTP responses.

Here are some of the main design principles of RESTful APIs using HTTP:

REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:

REST APIs use a uniform interface, which helps to decouple the client and service implementations. For REST APIs built on HTTP, the uniform interface includes using standard HTTP verbs to perform operations on resources. The most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

REST APIs use a stateless request model. HTTP requests should be independent and may occur in any order, so keeping transient state information between requests is not feasible. The only place where information is stored is in the resources themselves, and each request should be an atomic operation. This constraint enables web services to be highly scalable, because there is no need to retain any affinity between clients and specific servers. Any server can handle any request from any client. That said, other factors can limit scalability. For example, many web services write to a backend data store, which may be hard to scale out. For more information about strategies to scale out a data store, see Horizontal, vertical, and functional data partitioning.

REST APIs are driven by hypermedia links that are contained in the representation. For example, the following shows a JSON representation of an order. It contains links to get or update the customer associated with the order.

```
{
    "orderID":3,
    "productID":2,
    "quantity":4,
    "orderValue":16.60,
    "links": [
        {"rel":"product","href":"https://adventure-works.com/customers/3", "action":"GET" },
        {"rel":"product","href":"https://adventure-works.com/customers/3", "action":"PUT" }
    ]
}
```

## Define API operations in terms of HTTP methods

The HTTP protocol defines a number of methods that assign semantic meaning to a request. The common HTTP methods used by most RESTful web APIs are:

- GET retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.
- POST creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource. Note that POST can also be used to trigger operations that don't actually create resources.
- PUT either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.
- PATCH performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.
  DELETE removes the resource at the specified URI.

## Media types

As mentioned earlier, clients and servers exchange representations of resources. For example, in a POST request, the request body contains a representation of the resource to create. In a GET request, the response body contains a representation of the fetched resource.

In the HTTP protocol, formats are specified through the use of media types, also called MIME types. For non-binary data, most web APIs support JSON (media type = application/json) and possibly XML (media type = application/xml).

The Content-Type header in a request or response specifies the format of the representation. Here is an example of a POST request that includes JSON data:

```
POST https://adventure-works.com/orders HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 57

{"Id":1,"Name":"Gizmo","Category":"Widgets","Price":1.99}
```

## GET methods

A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK). If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

## POST methods

If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created). The URI of the new resource is included in the Location header of the response. The response body contains a representation of the resource.

If the method does some processing but does not create a new resource, the method can return HTTP status code 200 and include the result of the operation in the response body. Alternatively, if there is no result to return, the method can return HTTP status code 204 (No Content) with no response body.

If the client puts invalid data into the request, the server should return HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request). The response body can contain additional information about the error or a link to a URI that provides more details.

## PUT methods

If a PUT method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created), as with a POST method. If the method updates an existing resource, it returns either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). In some cases, it might not be possible to update an existing resource. In that case, consider returning HTTP status code 409 (Conflict).

Consider implementing bulk HTTP PUT operations that can batch updates to multiple resources in a collection. The PUT request should specify the URI of the collection, and the request body should specify the details of the resources to be modified. This approach can help to reduce chattiness and improve performance.

## PATCH methods

With a PATCH request, the client sends a set of updates to an existing resource, in the form of a patch document. The server processes the patch document to perform the update. The patch document doesn't describe the whole resource, only a set of changes to apply. The specification for the PATCH method (RFC 5789) doesn't define a particular format for patch documents. The format must be inferred from the media type in the request.

JSON is probably the most common data format for web APIs. There are two main JSON-based patch formats, called JSON patch and JSON merge patch.

JSON merge patch is somewhat simpler. The patch document has the same structure as the original JSON resource, but includes just the subset of fields that should be changed or added. In addition, a field can be deleted by specifying null for the field value in the patch document. (That means merge patch is not suitable if the original resource can have explicit null values.)

## DELETE methods

If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content), indicating that the process has been successfully handled, but that the response body contains no further information. If the resource doesn't exist, the web server can return HTTP 404 (Not Found).

## Asynchronous operations

Sometimes a POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE operation might require processing that takes a while to complete. If you wait for completion before sending a response to the client, it may cause unacceptable latency. If so, consider making the operation asynchronous. Return HTTP status code 202 (Accepted) to indicate the request was accepted for processing but is not completed.

You should expose an endpoint that returns the status of an asynchronous request, so the client can monitor the status by polling the status endpoint. Include the URI of the status endpoint in the Location header of the 202 response. For example:

```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: /api/status/12345
```

## HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "status":"In progress",
    "link": { "rel":"cancel", "method":"delete", "href":"/api/status/12345" }
}
```

## Filter and paginate data

Exposing a collection of resources through a single URI can lead to applications fetching large amounts of data when only a subset of the information is required. For example, suppose a client application needs to find all orders with a cost over a specific value. It might retrieve all orders from the /orders URI and then filter these orders on the client side. Clearly this process is highly inefficient. It wastes network bandwidth and processing power on the server hosting the web API.

Instead, the API can allow passing a filter in the query string of the URI, such as /orders?minCost=n. The web API is then responsible for parsing and handling the minCost parameter in the query string and returning the filtered results on the server side.

GET requests over collection resources can potentially return a large number of items.

## Use HATEOAS to enable navigation to related resources

One of the primary motivations behind REST is that it should be possible to navigate the entire set of resources without requiring prior knowledge of the URI scheme. Each HTTP GET request should return the information necessary to find the resources related directly to the requested object through hyperlinks included in the response, and it should also be provided with information that describes the operations available on each of these resources. This principle is known as HATEOAS, or Hypertext as the Engine of Application State. The system is effectively a finite state machine, and the response to each request contains the information necessary to move from one state to another; no other information should be necessary.

## Versioning a RESTful web API

It is highly unlikely that a web API will remain static. As business requirements change new collections of resources may be added, the relationships between resources might change, and the structure of the data in resources might be amended. While updating a web API to handle new or differing requirements is a relatively straightforward process, you must consider the effects that such changes will have on client applications consuming the web API. The issue is that although the developer designing and implementing a web API has full control over that API, the developer does not have the same degree of control over client applications, which may be built by third-party organizations operating remotely. The primary imperative is to enable existing client applications to continue functioning unchanged while allowing new client applications to take advantage of new features and resources.

Versioning enables a web API to indicate the features and resources that it exposes, and a client application can submit requests that are directed to a specific version of a feature or resource. The following sections describe several different approaches, each of which has its own benefits and trade-offs.
