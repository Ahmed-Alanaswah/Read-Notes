## Lists & Keys

First, let’s review how you transform lists in JavaScript.

Given the code below, we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it:

```const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number \* 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

## Keys

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:

```
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>
    {number}
  </li>
);

```

## How to Use the Spread Operator (…) in JavaScript

The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

## What is the spread operator?

inJ avaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.
“When `...arr` is used in the function call, it ‘expands’ an iterable object arr into the list of arguments.” — JavaScript.info
The spread operator was added to JavaScript in ES6 (ES2015), just like the rest parameters, which have the same syntax: three magic dots ….

## What else can … do?

The `…` spread operator is useful for many different routine tasks in JavaScript, including the following:

- Copying an array
- Concatenating or combining arrays

```
const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
```

- Using Math functions

```
const numbers = [37, -17, 7, 0]
console.log(Math.min(numbers)) // NaN
console.log(Math.min(...numbers)) // -17
console.log(Math.max(...numbers)) // 37
```

- Using an array as arguments
- Adding an item to a list

```
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌
```

- Adding to state in React
- Combining objects

```
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂
```

- Converting NodeList to an array
