## Custom User Model

for a real-world project, the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model instead. This provides far more flexibility down the line so, as a general rule, always use a custom user model for all new Django projects.


## Setup
```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir accounts && cd accounts
$ pipenv install django~=3.1.0
$ pipenv shell
(accounts) $ django-admin.py startproject config .
(accounts) $ python manage.py startapp accounts
(accounts) $ python manage.py runserver
```

## AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser

AbstractBaseUser requires much, much more work.
So we'll use AbstractUser which actually subclasses AbstractBaseUser but provides more default configuration.

## Custom User Model

Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

* update config/settings.py
* create a new CustomUser model
* create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
* update the admin


## Superuser
It's helpful to create a superuser that we can use to log in to the admin and test out log in/log out. On the command line type the following command and go through the prompts.


```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
