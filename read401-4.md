# Classes and Objects

Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

A very basic class would look something like this:
'''
class MyClass:
variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

'''
We'll explain why you have to include that "self" as a parameter a little bit later. First, to assign the above class(template) to an object you would do the following:

'''
class MyClass:
variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()
'''

## Accessing Object Variables

To access the variable inside of the newly created object "myobjectx" you would do the following:

'''
class MyClass:
variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.variable
'''
So for instance the below would output the string "blah":

'''
class MyClass:
variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

print(myobjectx.variable)
'''
You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class. For instance, if we were to define another object with the "MyClass" class and then change the string in the variable above:

'''
class MyClass:
variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()
myobjecty = MyClass()

myobjecty.variable = "yackity"

'Then print out both values'

print(myobjectx.variable)
print(myobjecty.variable)
'''

## Accessing Object Functions

To access a function inside of an object you use notation similar to accessing a variable:

'''
class MyClass:
variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.function()
'''

# Thinking Recursively in Python

The algorithm for iterative present delivery implemented in Python:

'''
houses = ["Eric's house", "Kenny's house", "Kyle's house", "Stan's house"]

def deliver_presents_iteratively():
for house in houses:
print("Delivering presents to", house)
'''

> > > deliver_presents_iteratively()

> > > Delivering presents to Eric's house

> > > Delivering presents to Kenny's house

> > > Delivering presents to Kyle's house

> > > Delivering presents to Stan's house

This is the typical structure of a recursive algorithm. If the current problem represents a simple case, solve it. If not, divide it into subproblems and apply the same strategy to them.

## Recursive Functions in Python

To demonstrate this structure, let’s write a recursive function for calculating n!:

1. Decompose the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem. This is the recursive case:

'''
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1
n! = n x (n−1)!
'''

2. As the large problem is broken down into successively less complex ones, those subproblems must eventually become so simple that they can be solved without further subdivision. This is the base case:

'''
n! = n x (n−1)!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2)!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3)!
⋅
⋅
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1!
'''
Recursive function for calculating n! implemented in Python:

'''
def factorial_recursive(n): # Base case: 1! = 1
if n == 1:
return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)

'''

> > > 120
