## ERROR HANDLING AND DEBUGGING

### ORDER OF EXECUTION

To find the source of an error, it helps to know how scripts are processed.
The order in which statements are executed can be complex; some tasks
cannot complete until another statement or function has been run:

### EXECUTION CONTEXTS

The JavaScript interpreter uses the concept of execution contexts.
There is one global execution context; plus, each function creates a new
new execution context. They correspond to variable scope.

### EXECUTION CONTEXT & HOISTING

Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases
of activity:

1. PREPARE

- The new scope is created
- Variables, functions, and arguments are created
- The value of the this keyword is determined

2. EXECUTE

- Now it can assign values to variables
- Reference functions and run their code
- Execute statements

### UNDERSTANDING SCOPE

In the interpreter, each execution context has its own va ri ables object.
It holds the variables, functions, and parameters available within it.
Each execution context can also access its parent's v a ri ables object.

### UNDERSTANDING ERRORS

If a JavaScript statement generates an error, then it throws an exception.
At that point, the interpreter stops and looks for exception-handling code.

### ERROR OBJECTS

Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are
and browsers have tools to help you read them.

### HOW TO DEAL WITH ERRORS

1. DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS
   If you come across an error while writing a script
   (or when someone reports a bug), you will need to
   debug the code, track down the source of the error,
   and fix it.

2. HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY
   You can handle errors gracefully using try, catch,
   throw, and f i na 1 ly statement s.

### A DEBUGGING WORKFLOW

- **_WHERE IS THE PROBLEM?_**
  First, should try to can narrow down the area where
  the problem seems to be. In a long script, this is
  especially important.

- **_WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM?_**
  Once you think that you might know the rough area
  in which your problem is located, you can then try to
  find the actual line of code that is causing the error.

### BROWSER DEV TOOLS & JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE

The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script,
where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be.

### BREAKPOINTS

You can pause the execution of a script on any
line using breakpoints. Then you can check the
va lues stored in variables at that point in time.

### STEPPING THROUGH CODE

If you set multiple breakpoints, you can step
through them one-by-one to see where values
change and a problem might occur.

### BREAKPOINTS

You can indicate that a breakpoint should be
triggered only if a condition that you specify is
met. The condition can use existing variables.

### HANDLING EXCEPTIONS

If you know your code might fail, use try, catch, and finally.
Each one is given its own code block.

```
 try {
    frameworkThatCanThrow();
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error('New error message', { cause: err });
  }
```
