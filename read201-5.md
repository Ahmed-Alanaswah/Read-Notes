# HTML 
## IMAGE 
### Adding Images 
**To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>` element. This is an empty element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:**

* src: This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site.

* alt: This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

* title:
You can also use the title
attribute with the `<img>` element
to provide additional information
about the image.

## Where to Place Images In Your Code

1. before a paragraph.
2. inside the start of a paragraph.
3. in the middle of a paragraph.


### FiGure and Figure Caption

* Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new ` <figure> ` element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.
You can have more than one
image inside the `<figure>`
element as long as they all share
the same caption.`

* The `<figcaption> `element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.
Before these elements were
created there was no way to
associate an` <img>` element with
its caption.

## color 

### rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90).

### hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80.

### color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan


## background-color

CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.

***Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.*** 

## opacity 
CSS3 introduces the opacity
property which allows you to
specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).


### HSL color

CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values.

* is the colloquial idea of
color. In HSL colors, hue is often
represented as a color circle
where the angle represents the
color, although it may also be
shown as a slider with values
from 0 to 360.

* Saturation is the amount of
gray in a color. Saturation is
represented as a percentage.
100% is full saturation and 0%
is a shade of gray.

* Lightness is the amount of
white (lightness) or black
(darkness) in a color. Lightness
is represented as a percentage.
0% lightness is black, 100%
lightness is white, and 50%
lightness is normal. Lightness
is sometimes referred to as
luminosity.

## TEXT 
### Specifying Typefaces 
**font-family:**
* The font-family property
allows you to specify the
typeface that should be used for
any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.
* The value of this property is the
name of the typeface you want
to use.

**font-size:**
The font-size property enables
you to specify a size for the
font.

## @font-face
@font-face allows you to use
a font, even if it is not installed
on the computer of the person
browsing, by allowing you to
specify a path to a copy of the
font, which will be downloaded if
it is not on the user's machine.

### font-family
This specifies the name of the
font. This name can then be used
as a value of the font-family
property in the rest of the style
sheet.

### SRC 

This specifies the path to the
font. In order for this technique
to work in all browsers, you will
probably need to specify paths
to a few different versions of the
font.

### format
* This specifies the format that the
font is supplied in. 

* Different browsers support
different formats for fonts
(in the same way that they
support different audio and
video formats), so you will need
to supply the font in several
variations to reach all browsers.

## font-weight
The font-weight property
allows you to create bold text.
There are two values that this
property commonly takes:

### normal
This causes text to appear at a
normal weight.

### bold
This causes text to appear bold.


### font-style

* **normal**
This causes text to appear in a
normal style (as opposed to italic
or oblique).
* **italic**
This causes text to appear italic.
* **oblique**
This causes text to appear
oblique.

## text-transform

### ppercase
This causes the text to appear
### uppercase.
lowercase
This causes the text to appear
### lowercase.
capitalize
This causes the first letter of
each word to appear capitalized.


## text-decoration 

### none
This removes any decoration
already applied to the text.
### underline
This adds a line underneath the
text.
### overline
This adds a line over the top of
the text.
### line-through
This adds a line through words.
### blink
This animates the text to make it
flash on and off (however this is
generally frowned upon, as it is
considered rather annoying).

## text-align

### left
This indicates that the text
should be left-aligned.
### right
This indicates that the text
should be right-aligned.
### center
This allows you to center text.
### justify
This indicates that every line in
a paragraph, except the last line,
should be set to take up the full
width of the containing box.


### text-indent 
The text-indent property
allows you to indent the first
line of text within an element.
The amount you want the line
indented by can be specified in
a number of ways but is usually
given in pixels or ems.
