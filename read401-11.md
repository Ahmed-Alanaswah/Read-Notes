JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner

You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computing, for example:

- Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.

- Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.

- Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.

- Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite document

## JupyterLab Releases

Since JupyterLab 0.32 (February 2018), the releases of JupyterLab are suitable for general daily use by both Jupyter novices and users experienced with the Classic Notebook interface. As of the 1.0 release (June 2019), it is additionally ready for extension writers who wish to further customize the JupyterLab experience for others. Please review the Changelog for detailed descriptions of each release.

The extension developer API is evolving, and we also are currently iterating on UI/UX improvements. We appreciate feedback on our GitHub issues page as we evolve towards a stable extension development API.

JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook. Throughout this transition, the same notebook document format will be supported by both the classic Notebook and JupyterLab.

## NumPy Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python

### Lists Of Lists for CSV Data

Before using NumPy, we’ll first try to work with the data using Python and the csv package. We can read in the file using the csv.reader object, which will allow us to read in and split up all the content from the ssv file.

In the below code, we:

Import the csv library.
Open the winequality-red.csv file.
With the file open, create a new csv.reader object.
Pass in the keyword argument delimiter=";" to make sure that the records are split up on the semicolon character instead of the default comma character.
Call the list type to get all the rows from the file.
Assign the result to wines.

### Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays

ith NumPy, we work with multidimensional arrays. We’ll dive into all of the possible types of multidimensional arrays later on, but for now, we’ll focus on 2-dimensional arrays. A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix, and is something you should be familiar with. In fact, it’s just a different way of thinking about a list of lists. A matrix has rows and columns. By specifying a row number and a column number, we’re able to extract an element from a matrix.

### Creating A NumPy Array

```
import csv
with open("winequality-red.csv", 'r') as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=";"))
import numpy as np
wines = np.array(wines[1:], dtype=np.float)
```

### Using NumPy To Read In Files

```
wines = np.genfromtxt("winequality-red.csv", delimiter=";", skip_header=1)
```
