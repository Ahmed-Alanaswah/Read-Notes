# pandas in data science

## The most elementary functions of pandas

### Reading data

```
data = pd.read_csv('my_file.csv')
```

```
data = pd.read_csv('my_file.csv', sep=';', encoding='latin-1', nrows=1000, skiprows=[2,5])

```

### Writing data

```
data.to_csv('my_new_file.csv', index=None)
```

### Checking the data

```
data.shape
```

### Seeing the data

```
data.head(3)
```

### Basic plotting

This feature is made possible thanks to the matplotlib package. As we said in the intro, it’s usable directly in pandas.

```
data['column_numerical'].plot()
```

```
data['column_numerical'].hist()
```

## Correlation and scatter matrices

```
pd.plotting.scatter_matrix(data, figsize=(12,8))
```

## Advanced operations in pandas

### Grouping

Not quite simple at the beginning, you need to master the syntax first and you’ll see yourself using this feature all the time.

### Iterating over rows

The .iterrows() loops through 2 variables together: the index of the row and the row (i and row in the code above)

Overall pandas is one of the reason why Python is such a great language
There are many other interesting pandas features I could have shown, but it’s already enough to understand why a data scientist cannot do without pandas.
To sum up, pandas is
simple to use, hiding all the complex and abstract computations behind
(generally) intuitive
fast, if not the fastest data analysis package (it highly optimized in C)
It is THE tool that helps a data scientist to quickly read and understand data and be more efficient at his role.
I hope you found this article useful, and if you did, consider giving at least 50 claps :)
