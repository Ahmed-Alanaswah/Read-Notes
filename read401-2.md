# In Tests We Trust — TDD with Python

### Unit tests and TDD?

Probably there are million of blog posts about this subject. But let’s talk just a bit about it on my point of view!

Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.

But Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think (and write!) tests first.

### The freela

Imagine that a client has a website and through it he receives a lot of contacts from potential customers. After a while he realized that it is important for the business to identify the profile of consumer: age, gender, job and so on. But the website just receive the name and the email.
They hired you to identify the gender of a person based on his/her name. Luckily, there is an amazing API called Genderize.io that identifies the possible genders. And you quickly developed your API connection:

'''
requests.get('https://api.genderize.io/?name=ana')
'''
However the client demands you to write unit tests and you are curious about TDD. Here our journey begins!

### Baby Steps

The API is pretty straightforward and your work was almost done. But with TDD we need to think about tests first. And to be ok with the possibility of the beginning to be hard sometimes — and it’s totally fine. Really.
Coming back to the code and thinking with baby steps, what is the smaller test that we can do against a function (method/class) that will return the gender?
Time for you to think
Just recaping: we have a name as input and we need to return a gender as output. So, the smaller test is: given a name, return a gender.

### Important aspects about the unit test

Let’s write our first test!

```
def test_should_return_female_when_the_name_is_from_female_gender():
    detector = GenderDetector()
    expected_gender = detector.run(‘Ana’)
    assert expected_gender == ‘female’
```

There are some details to pay attention. The first one is the test name. The tests can be considered as your alive documentation. We need to be descriptive about it and to say what is expected and what we are testing. In this case we explicitly said: should return female when the name is from a female.

The test file name should follow the same name of module name. For instance, if our module is gender.py, our test name should be test_gender.py. It’s ideal to separate the tests folder from production code
'''
mymodule/
— module.py
— another_folder/
— — another_module.py
tests/
— test_module.py
— another_folder/
— — test_another_module.py
'''

Other thing to care about is the structure. A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert. -**Arrange**: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input); -**Act**: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour); -**Assert**: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.

## The Cycle

I hope at this time you didn’t give up of this text because this is an example of an important thing about TDD: the cycle.
The cycle is made by three steps:
🆘 Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn’t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
✅ Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
🔵 Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one (don’t be shy)

# What does the if **name** == “**main**”: do?

Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables.
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special **name** variable to have a value “**main**”. If this file is being imported from another module, **name** will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to **name** global variable.
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.

## Recursion

### What is Recursion?

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc

'''
approach(1) – Simply adding one by one

f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 +……..+ n
'''

but there is another mathematical approach of representing this,

'''
f(n) = 1 n=1

f(n) = n + f(n-1) n>1
''
There is a simple difference between the approach (1) and approach(2) and that is in approach(2) the function “ f( ) ” itself is being called inside the function, so this phenomenon is named as recursion and the function containing recursion is called recursive function, at the end this is a great tool in the hand of the programmers to code some problems in a lot easier and efficient way.

In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.
