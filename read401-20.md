## Django Models

when we built a project the project have a data and we need to relatio nthese data to gother as a tables
in database so to do that we need use something call model so we will model these data to shape it using
class

```
from django.db import models

class MyModelName(models.Model):
    """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

    # Fields
    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
    ...

    # Metadata
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-my_field_name']

    # Methods
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the url to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
        return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
        return self.my_field_name
```

## Fields

we have in models many types of fields :

- CharField : it is characters fiels we cane use it t o name or user name
- TextField : use it to make descreption
- IntegerField : can use to store number
- DateField : can use it to get time
- EmailField is used to store and validate email addresses.
- FileField and ImageField are used to upload files and images respectively .
- AutoField is a special type of IntegerField that automatically increments. A primary key of this type is automatically added to your model if you donâ€™t explicitly specify one.
- ForeignKey is used to specify a one-to-many relationship to another database model (e.g. a car has one manufacturer, but a manufacturer can make many cars).
- ManyToManyField is used to specify a many-to-many relationship (e.g. a book can have several genres, and each genre can contain several books).

  **if we have a book web app we can draw relation between data (models):**
