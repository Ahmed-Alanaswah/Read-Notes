**Attribute in html **

Attributes provide additional information
about the contents of an element. They appear
on the opening tag of the element and are
made up of two parts: a name and a value,
separated by an equals sign.

## Escape Characters
There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the
left and right angled brackets.)

## HTML5
The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

## site maps

A sitemap is a file where you provide information about the pages, videos, and other files on your site, and the relationships between them. Search engines like Google read this file to crawl your site more efficiently. A sitemap tells Google which pages and files you think are important in your site, and also provides valuable information about these files. For example, when the page was last updated and any alternate language versions of the page.


**You might need a sitemap if:**

* Your site is really large.
* Your site has a large archive of content pages that are 
isolated or not well linked to each other.
* Your site is new and has few external links to it.
Your site has a lot of rich media content (video, images) or is shown in Google News.


**You might not need a sitemap if:**

* Your site is "small".
* Your site is comprehensively linked internally.
* You don't have many media files (video, image) or news pages that you want to show in search results.

## WIREFRAME
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require.

## OPJECTS & PROPERTIES

**OBJECTS (THINGS)**

In computer programming, each physica l thing in
the world can be represented as an object. There are
two different types of objects here: a hotel and a car.

**PROPERTIES (CHARACTERISTICS)**

Both of the cars share common characteristics.
In fact, all cars have a make, a color, and engine
size. You could even determine their current
speed. Programmers call these characteristics the
properties of an object.

**EVENTS**

WHAT IS AN EVENT?

There are common ways in which people interact
with each type of object. For example, in a car a
driver will typically use at least two pedals. The car
has been designed to respond differently when the
driver interacts with each of the different pedals:

* The accelerator makes the car go faster
* The brake slows it down

** WHAT DOES AN EVENT DO? **

Programmers choose which events they respond to.
When a specific event happens, that event can be
used to trigger a specific section of the code.


## METHODES

### WHAT IS A METHOD?

Methods typically represent how people (or other
things) interact with an object in the real world.


### WHAT DOES A METHOD DO?

The code for a method can contain lots of
instructions that together represent one task.

**DOCUMENT OBJECT**

The current web page loaded into each window is
modelled using a document object.

### HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE ?
1. the BROWSER receives an html page.
2. it creates a model of the page and stores it in a memory.
3. it shows the page on screen using a rendering engine.
