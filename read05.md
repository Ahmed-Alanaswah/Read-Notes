# Loops and iteration

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. 


There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times.

The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

- for statement
- do...while statement
- while statement
- labeled statement
- break statement
- continue statement
- for...in statement
- for...of statement


## for statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

A for statement looks as follows:


> for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression];[incrementExpression])
  statement


## do...while statement
The ` do...while `  statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

A `do...while` statement looks as follows:

> do

>  statement

>while (condition);

## while statement
A `while` statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A `while` statement looks as follows:

> while (condition)

> statement

## break statement
Use the ` break` statement to terminate a loop, `switch`, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.


## continue statement
The `continue` statement can be used to ** restart a while, do-while, for, or label **statement.


## Operators
**JavaScript** has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators
