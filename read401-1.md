# Logarithms

Logarithms are slightly trickier to explain so I’ll use a common example:

Binary search is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value. If the values match, it will return success. If the target value is higher than the value of the probe element, it will take the upper half of the data set and perform the same operation against it. Likewise, if the target value is lower than the value of the probe element, it will perform the operation against the lower half. It will continue to halve the data set with each iteration until the value has been found or until it can no longer split the data set.

This type of algorithm is described as O(log N). The iterative halving of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase e.g. an input data set containing 10 items takes one second to complete, a data set containing 100 items takes two seconds, and a data set containing 1,000 items will take three seconds. Doubling the size of the input data set has little effect on its growth as after a single iteration of the algorithm the data set will be halved and therefore on a par with an input data set half the size. This makes algorithms like binary search extremely efficient when dealing with large data sets.

### O(1)

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

```
bool IsFirstElementNull(IList<String> elements)
{
    return elements[0] == null;

```

### O(N)

O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. The example below also demonstrates how Big O favours the worst-case performance scenario; a matching string could be found during any iteration of the for loop and the function would return early, but Big O notation will always assume the upper limit where the algorithm will perform the maximum number of iterations.

```
bool ContainsValue(IEnumerable<string> elements, string value)
{
    foreach (var element in elements)
    {
        if (element == value) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### O(N²)

O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N³), O(N⁴) etc.

```
bool ContainsDuplicates(IList<string> elements)
{
    for (var outer = 0; outer < elements.Count; outer++)
    {
        for (var inner = 0; inner < elements.Count; inner++)
        {
            // Don't compare with self
            if (outer == inner) continue;

            if (elements[outer] == elements[inner]) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

### O(2^N)

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2^N) function is exponential — starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically. An example of an O(2^N) function is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers:

```
int Fibonacci(int number)
{
    if (number <= 1) return number;

    return Fibonacci(number - 2) + Fibonacci(number - 1);
}

```

## In conclusion

Hopefully this has helped remove some of the mystery around Big O notation and many of the common growth functions. A grasp of Big O is an important tool when dealing with algorithms that need to operate at scale, allowing you to make the correct choices and acknowledge trade-offs when working with different data sets.

## The Python Environment

The Interpreter
Let’s get started with the most important thing when working with python: the interpreter. For sure you could just simply download and install your favorite version of python and put everything into that. But what if you have programs that require different python versions or programs that depend on different versions of the same third-party module and you want to switch between those programs seamlessly?

Pyenv is a set of three tools, from which I present two here, that are pyenv (used to install python) and pyenv-virtualenv (used to configure your global tools). You can install them by

`curl https://pyenv.run | bash`

After that, add the following lines to your .bashrc (same for .zshrc) to have pyenv available in your terminal

```
export PATH="~/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"

```

and finally, restart your terminal. Now, you can use pyenv to install almost any python interpreter, including pypy, and anaconda. Note, that pyenv builds python locally on your machine. Building python requires several libraries. On my Ubuntu machine, I have to install the following ones to not run into problems

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 bzip2 libbz2-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev openssl libgdbm-dev libgdbm-compat-dev liblzma-dev libreadline-dev libncursesw5-dev libffi-dev uuid-dev

```

Now, to install a python interpreter just do

```
pyenv install VERSION_YOU_WOULD_LIKE_TO_INSTALL

```
