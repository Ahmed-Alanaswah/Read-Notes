## LINKS

## Writing Links

Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything
between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening `<a>` tag. The value of this
attribute should be \_blank.

## LAYOUT

### BUILDING BLOCKS

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

**Block-level elements**
start on a new line
Examples include:
`<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`

**flow in between**
surrounding text
Examples include:
`<img> <b> <i>`

## Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

### Controlling the Position of Elements

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

- Normal flow
- Relative Positioning
- Ab solute positioning

## Screen Sizes

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.

## Layout Grids

Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

## CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

**Flexbox**
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces.

**Grids**
CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward.

## Why choose flexbox?

In a perfect world of browser support, the reason you'd choose to use flexbox is because you want to lay a collection of items out in one direction or another. As you lay out your items you want to control the dimensions of the items in that one dimension, or control the spacing between items. These are the uses that flexbox was designed for.
