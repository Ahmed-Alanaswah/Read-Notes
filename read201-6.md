# JavaScripts 
## object literals 

**what is an object**
Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

### decclaring

```
var myCar = {
    make: 'Ford',
    model: 'Mustang',
    year: 1969
};

```

### how to accessing on values

```
myCar['make'] = 'Ford';
myCar['model'] = 'Mustang';
myCar['year'] = 1969

```

# document object model 

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

## DOM TREE 
Each node is an object with methods and properties.
Scripts access and update this DOM tree (not the source HTML file).
Any changes made to the DOM tree are reflected in the browser.

### ACCESSING ELEMENTS

***getElementByld( 1 id 1)***
Selects an individual element given the value of its i d attribute .
The HTML must have an id attribute in order for it to be selectable.


***querySel ector( 1css selector ')***
Uses CSS selector syntax that would select one or more element s .
This method returns only the first of the matching elements.


***getEl ement sByClassName( 1class 1)***
Selects one or more elements given the va lue of their cl ass attribute.
The HTML must have a cl ass attribu te for it to be selectable.
This method is faster than querySe 1ectorA11 () .

***getEl ementsByTagName( 1 tagName 1)***
Selects all elements on the page with the specified tag name.
This method is faster than querySe 1ectorA11 ().


***querySelectorAll ( 1css select or â€¢)***
Uses CSS selector syntax to select one or more elements and returns all
of those that match.

an one element.

### TRAVERSING THE DOM

When you have an element node, you can select
another element in relation to it using these five
properties. This is known as traversing the DOM.

* parentNode.
* previousSibling
* nextSibling
* firstChil 
* lastChild


### WHITESPACE NODES

Traversing the DOM can be difficult because
some browsers add a text node whenever they
come across whitespace between elements


### ACCESS & UPDATE TEXT & MARKUP WITH INNERHTML

Using the i nnerHTML property, you can access
and amend the contents of an element,
including any child elements.

***innerHTML***

When getting HTML from an
element, the i nnerHTML property
will get the content of an
element and return it as one long
string, including any markup that
the element contains.

### ADDING ELEMENTS USING DOM MANIPULATION
1. createEl ement ().
2. createTextNode().
3. appendChild().

***document.write()***
The document object's write () method is a simple
way to add content that was not in the original
source code to the page, but its use is rarely advised.
