# HTML Forms

The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside `<form>...</form> `tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit"

```
<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```

The submit input will be displayed as a button (by default) that can be pressed by the user to upload the data in all the other input elements in the form to the server (in this case, just the team_name). The form attributes define the HTTP method used to send the data and the destination of the data on the server (action):

action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL.
* method: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get.
* The POST method should always be used if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database because this can be made more resistant to cross-site forgery request attacks.
The GET method should only be used for forms that don't change user data (e.g. a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL.

## Django form handling process

A process flowchart of how Django handles form requests is shown below, starting with a request for a page containing a form (shown in green).

* Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.

* Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.

* Clean and validate the data.

* If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.

* If all data is valid, perform required actions (e.g. save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, etc.)

* Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.
