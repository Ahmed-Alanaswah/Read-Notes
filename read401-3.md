# Python Exceptions: An Introduction

## Exceptions versus Syntax Errors

Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement. Observe the following example:

'''

> > > print( 0 / 0 ))
> > > File "<stdin>", line 1

    print( 0 / 0 ))
                  ^

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
'''

'''

> > > print( 0 / 0)
> > > Traceback (most recent call last):
> > > File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
> > > ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero

'''

## Raising an Exception

We can use raise to throw an exception if a condition occurs. The statement can be complemented with a custom exception.

If you want to throw an error when a certain condition occurs using raise, you could go about it like this:

'''
x = 10
if x > 5:
raise Exception('x should not exceed 5. The value of x was: {}'.format(x))
'''

When you run this code, the output will be the following:

'''
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<input>", line 4, in <module>
Exception: x should not exceed 5. The value of x was: 10
'''

## The AssertionError Exception

Instead of waiting for a program to crash midway, you can also start by making an assertion in Python. We assert that a certain condition is met. If this condition turns out to be True, then that is excellent! The program can continue. If the condition turns out to be False, you can have the program throw an AssertionError exception.

Have a look at the following example, where it is asserted that the code will be executed on a Linux system:

'''
import sys
assert ('linux' in sys.platform), "This code runs on Linux only."
'''

If you run this code on a Linux machine, the assertion passes. If you were to run this code on a Windows machine, the outcome of the assertion would be False and the result would be the following:

'''
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<input>", line 2, in <module>
AssertionError: This code runs on Linux only.
'''

## The try and except Block: Handling Exceptions

As you saw earlier, when syntactically correct code runs into an error, Python will throw an exception error. This exception error will crash the program if it is unhandled. The except clause determines how your program responds to exceptions.

## The else Clause

In Python, using the else statement, you can instruct a program to execute a certain block of code only in the absence of exceptions.

## Cleaning Up After Using finally

Imagine that you always had to implement some sort of action to clean up after executing your code. Python enables you to do so using the finally clause.

# Reading and Writing Files in Python (Guide)

## What Is a File?

Before we can go into how to work with files in Python, it’s important to understand what exactly a file is and how modern operating systems handle some of their aspects.

At its core, a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer

## File Paths

When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. It’s broken up into three major parts:

1. Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
2. File Name: the actual name of the file
3. Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

|
└── animals.csv

## Line Endings

One problem often encountered when working with file data is the representation of a new line or line ending. The line ending has its roots from back in the Morse Code era, when a specific pro-sign was used to communicate the end of a transmission or the end of a line.

Later, this was standardized for teleprinters by both the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the American Standards Association (ASA). ASA standard states that line endings should use the sequence of the Carriage Return (CR or \r) and the Line Feed (LF or \n) characters (CR+LF or \r\n). The ISO standard however allowed for either the CR+LF characters or just the LF character.

Windows uses the CR+LF characters to indicate a new line, while Unix and the newer Mac versions use just the LF character. This can cause some complications when you’re processing files on an operating system that is different than the file’s source. Here’s a quick example. Let’s say that we examine the file dog_breeds.txt that was created on a Windows system

'''
Pug\r\n
Jack Russell Terrier\r\n
English Springer Spaniel\r\n
German Shepherd\r\n
Staffordshire Bull Terrier\r\n
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\r\n
Golden Retriever\r\n
West Highland White Terrier\r\n
Boxer\r\n
Border Terrier\r\n
'''
This same output will be interpreted on a Unix device differently:

'''
Pug\r
\n
Jack Russell Terrier\r
\n
English Springer Spaniel\r
\n
German Shepherd\r
\n
Staffordshire Bull Terrier\r
\n
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\r
\n
Golden Retriever\r
\n
West Highland White Terrier\r
\n
Boxer\r
\n
Border Terrier\r
\n

## Opening and Closing a File in Python

When you want to work with a file, the first thing to do is to open it. This is done by invoking the open() built-in function. open() has a single required argument that is the path to the file. open() has a single return, the file object:

'''
file = open('dog_breeds.txt')
'''

When you’re manipulating a file, there are two ways that you can use to ensure that a file is closed properly, even when encountering an error. The first way to close a file is to use the try-finally block

'''
reader = open('dog_breeds.txt')
try: # Further file processing goes here
finally:
reader.close()
'''

Most likely, you’ll also want to use the second positional argument, mode. This argument is a string that contains multiple characters to represent how you want to open the file. The default and most common is 'r', which represents opening the file in read-only mode as a text file:

'''
with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader: # Further file processing goes heres
'''

**Character** **Meaning**
'r' :Open for reading (default)
'w' :Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first
'rb' or 'wb': Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)
