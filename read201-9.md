# HTML & CSS

## form

_Form controls live inside a
`<form>` element. This element
should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a
method and id attribute too._

**action:**
Every `<form>` element requires
an action attribute. Its value
is the URL for the page on the
server that will receive the
information in the form when it
is submitted.

- **text input**

The `<input>` element is used
to create several different form
controls. The value of the type
attribute determines what kind
of input they will be creating.

- **type="text"**

When the type attribute has a
value of text, it creates a singleline
text input.

- **type="password"**

When the type attribute has
a value of password it creates
a text box that acts just like a
single-line text input, except
the characters are blocked out.
They are hidden in this way so
that if someone is looking over
the user's shoulder, they cannot
see sensitive data such as
passwords.

- **`<textarea>`**
  The `<textarea>` element
  is used to create a mutli-line
  text input. Unlike other input
  elements this is not an empty
  element. It should therefore have
  an opening and a closing tag.

- **type="radio"**
  Radio buttons allow users to pick
  just one of a number of options.

- **type="checkbox"**
  Checkboxes allow users to select
  (and unselect) one or more
  options in answer to a question.

### Drop Down Li st Box

- **`<select>`**
  A drop down list box (also
  known as a select box) allows
  users to select one option from a
  drop down list.
  The `<select>` element is used
  to create a drop down list box. It
  contains two or more `<option>`
  elements.

- **`<option>`**
  The `<option>` element is used
  to specify the options that the
  user can select from. The words
  between the opening `<option>`
  and closing `</option>` tags will
  be shown to the user in the drop
  down box.

- **type="file"**
  This type of input creates a
  box that looks like a text input
  followed by a browse button.
  When the user clicks on the
  browse button, a window opens
  up that allows them to select a
  file from their computer to be
  uploaded to the website.

- **type="submit"**
  The submit button is used to
  send a form to the server.

- **type="image"**
  If you want to use an image for
  the submit button, you can give
  the type attribute a value of
  image. The src, width, height,
  and alt attributes work just
  like they do when used with the
  `<img>` element
- **`<button>`**
  The `<button>` element was
  introduced to allow users more
  control over how their buttons
  appear, and to allow other
  elements to appear inside the
  button.

- **`<label>`**
  When introducing form controls,
  the code was kept simple by
  indicating the purpose of each
  one in text next to it. However,
  each form control should have
  its own `<label>`element as this
  makes the form accessible to
  vision-impaired users.

* **`<fieldset>`**
  You can group related form
  controls together inside the
  `<fieldset>` element. This is
  particularly helpful for longer
  forms.

- **`<legend>`**
  The `<legend>` element can
  come directly after the opening
  `<fieldset>` tag and contains a
  caption which helps identify the
  purpose of that group of form
  controls.

## LISTS

### list-style-type

- Unordered Lists:
  For an unordered list you can use
  the following values:
- Ordered Lists:
  For an ordered (numbered) list
  you can use the following values:

- _list-style-image_ :
  You can specify an image to act
  as a bullet point using the
  list-style-image property.

- _list-style-position_

  - outside
    The marker sits to the left of the
    block of text. (This is the default
    behaviour if this property is not
    used.)

    - inside
      The marker sits inside the box of
      text (which is indented).

### LIST STYLE

As with several of the other CSS
properties, there is a property
that acts as a shorthand for list
styles. It is called list-style,
and it allows you to express
the markers' style, image and
position properties in any order.

## JS

## EVENTS

HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

### HOW EVENTS TRIGGER JAVASCRIPT CODE

When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three
steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code.
Together these steps are known as event handling.

1. Select t he element
   node(s) you want the
   script to respond to.
2. Indicate which event on
   the selected node(s) will
   trigger the response.
3. State the code you want
   to run when the event
   occurs.

### THE EVENT OBJECT

When an event occurs, the event object tells
you information about the event, and the
element it happened upon.

### WHICH ELEMENT DID AN EVENT OCCUR ON?

When calling a function, the event object's target property is the best
way to determine which element the event occurred on. But you may see
the approach below used; it relies on the this keyword.

### USER INTERFACE EVENTS

User interface CUI) events occur as a result of interaction with the
browser window rather than the HTML page contained within it,
e.g., a page having loaded or the browser window being resized.

### FOCUS & BLUR EVENTS

The HTML elements you can interact with, such as links and form
elements, can gain focus. These events fire when they gain or lose focus.

### MOUSE EVENTS

The mouse events are fired when the mouse is moved and also when its
buttons are clicked.

### KEYBOARD EVENTS

The keyboard events are fired when a user interacts with the keyboard
(they fire on any kind of device with a keyboard).

### FORM EVENTS

There are two events that are commonly used with forms.
In particular you are likely to see submit used in form validation.

### MUTATION EVENTS & OBSERVERS

Whenever elements are added to or removed from the DOM, its
structure changes. This change triggers a mutation event.

**What can JavaScript Do?**
Event handlers can be used to handle and verify user input, user actions, and browser actions:

- Things that should be done every time a page loads
- Things that should be done when the page is closed
- Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
- Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
- And more ...

Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

- HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
- HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
- You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
- You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
  \*And more ...
