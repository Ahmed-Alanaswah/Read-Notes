# Trees

## Traversals

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

Depth First
Breadth First

## Depth First

Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root

### Pre-order

```
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left)

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)
```

Pre-order means that the root has to be looked at first. In our case, looking at the root just means that we output its value. When we call preOrder for the first time, the root will be added to the call stack

Next, we start reading our preOrder function’s code from top to bottom. The first line of code reads this:

```
OUTPUT <-- root.value
```

This means that we will output the root.value out to the console. Then, our next block of code instructs us to check if our root has a left node set. If the root does, we will then send the left node to our preOrder method recursively. This means that we make another function call, where B is our new root

This process continues until we reach a leaf node. Here’s the state of our tree when we hit our first leaf, D:

It’s important to note a few things that are about to happen:

- The program will look for both a root.left and a root.right. Both will return null, so it will end the execution of that method call
- D will pop off of the call stack and the root will be reassigned back to B
  - This is the heart of recursion: when we complete a function call, we pop it off the stack and are able to continue execution through the previous function call

The code block will now pick up where it left off when B was the root. Since it already looked for root.left, it will now look for root.right.

E will output to the console. Since E is a leaf, it will complete the method code block, and pop E off of the call stack and make its way back up to B.

n the function call, B has already checked for root.left, and root.right. There are no further lines of code to execute, so B will be popped off the call stack, so that we can resume execution of A.
