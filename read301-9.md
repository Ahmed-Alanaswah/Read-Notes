# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

## What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
So how do we know if a function is pure or not? Here is a very strict definition of purity:
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects
It returns the same result if given the same arguments
Imagine we want to implement a function that calculates the area of a circle. An impure function would receive radius as the parameter, and then calculate radius _ radius _ PI:

## Pure functions benefits

The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D
A simple example would be a function to receive a collection of numbers and expect it to increment each element of this collection.

## Immutability

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
In Javascript we commonly use the for loop. This next for statement has some mutable variables
So here we have the sum function that receives a vector of numerical values. The function calls itself until we get the list empty (our recursion base case). For each "iteration" we will add the value to the total accumulator.
With recursion, we keep our variables immutable. The list and the accumulator variables are not changed. It keeps the same value.
Observation: Yes! We can use reduce to implement this function. We will cover this in the Higher Order Functions topic.
It is also very common to build up the final state of an object. Imagine we have a string, and we want to transform this string into a url slug.
In OOP in Ruby, we would create a class, let’s say, UrlSlugify. And this class will have a slugify! method to transform the string input into a url slug.
**pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency**
With this concept, a cool thing we can do is to memoize the function.
