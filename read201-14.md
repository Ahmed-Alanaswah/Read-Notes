# CSS

## Transforms

The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.

## transition

CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

- transition
- transition-delay
- transition-duration
- transition-property
- transition-timing-function

## animation

CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!

properties:

- @keyframes
- animation-name
- animation-duration
- animation-delay
- animation-iteration-count
- animation-direction
- animation-timing-function
- animation-fill-mode
- animation

## What are CSS Animations?

When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.

The following example binds the "example" animation to the `<div>` element. The animation will last for 4 seconds, and it will gradually change the background-color of the `<div>` element from "red" to "yellow":

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 4s;
}

@keyframes example {
  from {background-color: red;}
  to {background-color: yellow;}
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p><b>Note:</b> This example does not work in Internet Explorer 9 and earlier versions.</p>

<div></div>

<p><b>Note:</b> When an animation is finished, it changes back to its original style.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

- The **animation-duration** property defines how long an animation should take to complete. If the animation-duration property is not specified, no animation will occur, because the default value is 0s (0 seconds).

- The **animation-delay** property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.

* The **animation-iteration-count** property specifies the number of times an animation should run.

* The **animation-direction** property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles
  - normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
  - reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
  - alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
  - alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards
* The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.
* The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).
