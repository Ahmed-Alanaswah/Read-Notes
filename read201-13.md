# Local Storage

Historically, web applications have had none of these luxuries. Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:

- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
- Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful

## What we really want is

- a lot of storage space
- on the client
- that persists beyond a page refresh
- and isn’t transmitted to the server

### INTRODUCING HTML5 STORAGE

**So what is HTML5 Storage?** Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

```
function supports_html5_storage() {
  try {
    return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}

```

Instead of writing this function yourself, you can use Modernizr to detect support for HTML5 Storage.

```
if (Modernizr.localstorage) {
  // window.localStorage is available!
} else {
  // no native support for HTML5 storage :(
  // maybe try dojox.storage or a third-party solution
}
```

### BEYOND NAMED KEY-VALUE PAIRS: COMPETING VISIONS

```
openDatabase('documents', '1.0', 'Local document storage', 5*1024*1024, function (db) {
  db.changeVersion('', '1.0', function (t) {
    t.executeSql('CREATE TABLE docids (id, name)');
  }, error);
});
```

his specification introduces two related mechanisms, similar to HTTP session cookies, for storing name-value pairs on the client side. [COOKIES]

The first is designed for scenarios where the user is carrying out a single transaction, but could be carrying out multiple transactions in different windows at the same time.

Cookies don't really handle this case well. For example, a user could be buying plane tickets in two different windows, using the same site. If the site used cookies to keep track of which ticket the user was buying, then as the user clicked from page to page in both windows, the ticket currently being purchased would "leak" from one window to the other, potentially causing the user to buy two tickets for the same flight without really noticing.

To address this, this specification introduces the sessionStorage getter. Sites can add data to the session storage, and it will be accessible to any page from the same site opened in that window.

**the length getter steps are to return this's map's size.**

**The key(index) method steps are:**

1. If index is greater than or equal to this's map's size, then return null.

2. Let keys be the result of running get the keys on this's map.

3. Return keys[index].

The supported property names on a Storage object storage are the result of running get the keys on storage's map.

The getItem(key) method steps are:

1. If this's map[key] does not exist, then return null.

2. 0Return this's map[key].

The setItem(key, value) method are:

1. Let oldValue be null.

2. Let reorder be true.

3. If this's map[key] exists:

   1. Set oldValue to this's map[key].

   2. If oldValue is value, then return.

   3. Set reorder to false.

4. If value cannot be stored, then throw a "QuotaExceededError" DOMException exception.

5. Set this's map[key] to value.

6. If reorder is true, then reorder this.

7. Broadcast this with key, oldValue, and value.

The removeItem(key) method steps are:

1. If this's map[key] does not exist, then return null.

2. Set oldValue to this's map[key].

3. Remove this's map[key].

4. Reorder this.

5. Broadcast this with key, oldValue, and null.

The clear() method steps are:

1. Clear this's map.

2. Broadcast this with null, null, and null.
