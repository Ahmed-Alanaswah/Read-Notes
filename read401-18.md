# shutil — High-level File Operations¶

## Copying Files

copyfile() copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError if it does not have permission to write to the destination file.

```
#shutil_copyfile.py
import glob
import shutil

print('BEFORE:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))

shutil.copyfile('shutil_copyfile.py', 'shutil_copyfile.py.copy')

print('AFTER:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))
```

Because the function opens the input file for reading, regardless of its type, special files (such as Unix device nodes) cannot be copied as new special files with copyfile().

```
$ python3 shutil_copyfile.py

BEFORE: ['shutil_copyfile.py']
AFTER: ['shutil_copyfile.py', 'shutil_copyfile.py.copy']
```

The implementation of copyfile() uses the lower-level function copyfileobj(). While the arguments to copyfile() are filenames, the arguments to copyfileobj() are open file handles. The optional third argument is a buffer length to use for reading in blocks.

```
import io
import os
import shutil
import sys


class VerboseStringIO(io.StringIO):

    def read(self, n=-1):
        next = io.StringIO.read(self, n)
        print('read({}) got {} bytes'.format(n, len(next)))
        return next


lorem_ipsum = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer
adipiscing elit.  Vestibulum aliquam mollis dolor. Donec
vulputate nunc ut diam. Ut rutrum mi vel sem. Vestibulum
ante ipsum.'''

print('Default:')
input = VerboseStringIO(lorem_ipsum)
output = io.StringIO()
shutil.copyfileobj(input, output)

print()

print('All at once:')
input = VerboseStringIO(lorem_ipsum)
output = io.StringIO()
shutil.copyfileobj(input, output, -1)

print()

print('Blocks of 256:')
input = VerboseStringIO(lorem_ipsum)
output = io.StringIO()
shutil.copyfileobj(input, output, 256)
```

The default behavior is to read using large blocks. Use -1 to read all of the input at one time or another positive integer to set a specific block size. This example uses several different block sizes to show the effect.

```
$ python3 shutil_copyfileobj.py

Default:
read(16384) got 166 bytes
read(16384) got 0 bytes

All at once:
read(-1) got 166 bytes
read(-1) got 0 bytes

Blocks of 256:
read(256) got 166 bytes
read(256) got 0 bytes
```

The copy() function interprets the output name like the Unix command line tool cp. If the named destination refers to a directory instead of a file, a new file is created in the directory using the base name of the source.

```
import glob
import os
import shutil

os.mkdir('example')
print('BEFORE:', glob.glob('example/*'))

shutil.copy('shutil_copy.py', 'example')

print('AFTER :', glob.glob('example/*'))
```

The permissions of the file are copied along with the contents.

```
$ python3 shutil_copy.py

BEFORE: []
AFTER : ['example/shutil_copy.py']
```

# Regular Expressions in Python

In Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. That means that if you want to start using them in your Python scripts, you have to import this module with the help of import:

```
import re
```

## Basic Patterns: Ordinary Characters

You can easily tackle many basic patterns in Python using ordinary characters. Ordinary characters are the simplest regular expressions. They match themselves exactly and do not have a special meaning in their regular expression syntax.

Examples are 'A', 'a', 'X', '5'.

Ordinary characters can be used to perform simple exact matches:

```
pattern = r"Cookie"
sequence = "Cookie"
if re.match(pattern, sequence):
    print("Match!")
else: print("Not a match!")
```

Do you notice the r at the start of the pattern Cookie?
This is called a raw string literal. It changes how the string literal is interpreted. Such literals are stored as they appear.

For example, \ is just a backslash when prefixed with an r rather than being interpreted as an escape sequence. You will see what this means with special characters. Sometimes, the syntax involves backslash-escaped characters, and to prevent these characters from being interpreted as escape sequences; you use the raw r prefix.

TIP: You don't actually need it for this example; however, it is a good practice to use it for consistency.

## Wild Card Characters: Special Characters

Special characters are characters that do not match themselves as seen but have a special meaning when used in a regular expression. For simple understanding, they can be thought of as reserved metacharacters that denote something else and not what they look like.

Let's check out some examples to see the special characters in action...

But before you do, the examples below make use of two functions namely: search() and group().
With the search function, you scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match.
The group function returns the string matched by the re. You will see both these functions in more detail later.

```
re.search(r'Co.k.e', 'Cookie').group()
```
