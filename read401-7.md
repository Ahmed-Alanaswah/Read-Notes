# Python Scope & the LEGB Rule: Resolving Names in Your Code

## Understanding Scope

In programming, the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on. A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope. Several programming languages take advantage of scope for avoiding name collisions and unpredictable behaviors. Most commonly, you’ll distinguish two general scopes:

1. Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

2. Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope

## Python Scope vs Namespace

In Python, the concept of scope is closely related to the concept of the namespace. As you’ve learned so far, a Python scope determines where in your program a name is visible. Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects. These dictionaries are commonly called namespaces. These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. They’re stored in a special attribute called .**dict**.

> > > import sys
> > > sys.**dict**.keys()
> > > dict_keys(['__name__', '__doc__', '__package__',..., 'argv', 'ps1', 'ps2'])

## Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope

- **Local (or function) scope:**
  is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. This Python scope contains the names that you define inside the function. These names will only be visible from the code of the function. It’s created at function call, not at function definition, so you’ll have as many different local scopes as function calls. This is true even if you call the same function multiple times, or recursively. Each call will result in a new local scope being created.

* **Enclosing (or nonlocal) scop:**
  is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.

* **Global (or module) scope:**i
  s the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in your code.

* **Built-in scope:**
  is a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session. This scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into Python. Names in this Python scope are also available from everywhere in your code. It’s automatically loaded by Python when you run a program or script.

**The LEGB rule** is a kind of name lookup procedure, which determines the order in which Python looks up names. For example, if you reference a given name, then Python will look that name up sequentially in the local, enclosing, global, and built-in scope. If the name exists, then you’ll get the first occurrence of it. Otherwise, you’ll get an error.

## Functions: The Local Scope

The **local scope** or function scope is a Python scope created at function calls. Every time you call a function, you’re also creating a new local scope. On the other hand, you can think of each def statement and lambda expression as a blueprint for new local scopes. These local scopes will come into existence whenever you call the function at hand.

```
> > > def square(base):
> > > ... result = base \*\* 2
> > > ... print(f'The square of {base} is: {result}')
> > > ...
> > > square(10)
> > > The square of 10 is: 100
> > > result # Isn't accessible from outside square()
> > > Traceback (most recent call last):
> > > File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

    result

NameError: name 'result' is not defined

> > > base # Isn't accessible from outside square()
> > > Traceback (most recent call last):
> > > File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

    base

NameError: name 'base' is not defined

> > > square(20)
> > > The square of 20 is: 400
> > > '''
```

### Nested Functions: The Enclosing Scope

Enclosing or nonlocal scope is observed when you nest functions inside other functions. The enclosing scope was added in Python 2.2. It takes the form of the local scope of any enclosing function’s local scopes. Names that you define in the enclosing Python scope are commonly known as nonlocal names. Consider the following code:

```
> > > def outer_func():
> > > ... # This block is the Local scope of outer_func()
> > > ... var = 100 # A nonlocal var
> > > ... # It's also the enclosing scope of inner_func()
> > > ... def inner_func():
> > > ... # This block is the Local scope of inner_func()
> > > ... print(f"Printing var from inner_func(): {var}")
> > > ...
> > > ... inner_func()
> > > ... print(f"Printing var from outer_func(): {var}")
> > > ...
> > > outer_func()
> > > Printing var from inner_func(): 100
> > > Printing var from outer_func(): 100
> > > inner_func()
> > > Traceback (most recent call last):
> > > File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
> > > NameError: name 'inner_func' is not defined
```

### Booleans

```def check(a):
if a*5 > 9 and a*5 < 100:
return True
 else:
return False
```

### Flow

Flow consists of if statements, elif (else if) statements, and else statements.

An if statement checks if a comparison is true.
An else statement checks if a comparison is not true. It is used after an if statement (and all elif statements after the if statement) and it shares the same comparison as the if statement.
An elif statement checks for two things: if a comparison is true, and if a comparison is not true. It is used right after the if statement.

```
if 10*5 > 9:
    if 10*5 < 100:
        print("Yes")
    else:
        print("No")
else:
    print("No")
```

## Functions

In this section, we will define new operations and do arithmetic with them in Python.

The New Operation
Let's say that you defined a new binary operation, the $\uparrow \downarrow.$ You want it to be so $a \uparrow \downarrow b = a^{b}b^{a}.$ Therefore, $1\uparrow \downarrow 2 = 1^{2}2^{1}=1\cdot 2= 2,$ and $2\uparrow \downarrow 3 = 2^33^2 = 8\cdot 9 = 72.$ Let's call this operation an up down arrow.

```
def up_down_arrow(a,b):
    return ((a**b) * (b**a))
```

## Random

Simulate the rolling of 1000 dice. Now, count the number of times you roll 6. Print that number out.

We can create a function that returns a random number from 1 to 6. Then, we can make a for loop that rolls the dice 1000 times and check if it is a 6.

```
import random
count = 0

def roll():
    return random.randint(1,6)

for i in range(1, 1001):
    if roll() == 6:
        count += 1
```
