## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

**Django** is a Python-based web framework and it used in many common apps like instegram and nasa and google .
**It is open source**: that is mean it has a big information and documintaion and large content and you can find any information or fix any error you will face it.

- why does an open-source project need funding?

  - It turns out that while writing code is fun and developers are generally willing to contribute their time for free to do so, there are a host of decidedly less fun tasks needed to maintain and sustain an open source project.

## URLs and views

To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.Object-relational mapper

```
rom django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('bands/', views.band_listing, name='band-list'),
    path('bands/<int:band_id>/', views.band_detail, name='band-detail'),
    path('bands/search/', views.band_search, name='band-search'),
]
```

```
from django.shortcuts import render

def band_listing(request):
    """A view of all bands."""
    bands = models.Band.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'bands/band_listing.html', {'bands': bands})
```

## templates

the django frame work si very strong and easy to leanrn for those that used to working with html

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Band Listing</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>All Bands</h1>
    <ul>
    {% for band in bands %}
      <li>
        <h2><a href="{{ band.get_absolute_url }}">{{ band.name }}</a></h2>
        {% if band.can_rock %}<p>This band can rock!</p>{% endif %}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

## forms

Django provides a way to generate forms from your existing models

```
from django import forms

class BandContactForm(forms.Form):
    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    message = forms.CharField()
    sender = forms.EmailField()
    cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)
```

Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

```
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.shortcuts import render

@login_required
def my_protected_view(request):
    """A view that can only be accessed by logged-in users"""
    return render(request, 'protected.html', {'current_user': request.user})
```

Django provides multiple protections against:

- Clickjacking
- Cross-site scripting
- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- SQL injection
- Remote code execution
