## TABLES

**_ What's a Table? _**

A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

## Basic Table St ructure

**`<table>`:**
The `<table>` element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.

**`<tr>`:**
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening `<tr>` tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)

**`<td>:`**
Each cell of a table is
represented using a `<td>`
element. (The td stands for
table data.)

## Table Headings

**`<th>`:**
The `<th`> element is used just
like the `<td>`element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.)

## Long Tables

**Long Tables:**

- `<thead>`:
  The headings of the table should
  sit inside the `<thead>` element.

- `<tbody>`
  The body should sit inside the
  `<tbody>` element.

- `<tfoot>`
  The footer belongs inside the
  `<tfoot>` element.

**_ WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS?_**
_Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the
browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These
built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages._

### THE BROWSER OBJECT MODEL: THE WINDOW OBJECT

The window object represents the current
browser window or tab. It is the topmost object
in the Browser Object Model, and it contains
other objects that tell you about the browser.

## DATE OBJECT

**_JavaScript Date objects represent a single moment in time in a platform-independent format. Date objects contain a Number that represents milliseconds since 1 January 1970 UTC._**

### Constructor

> `new Date()` creates a new date object with the current date and time:

```
Example:

const d = new Date();
```

`Date.now()`:
Returns the numeric value corresponding to the current time—the number of milliseconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC, with leap seconds ignored.

`Date.parse()`:
Parses a string representation of a date and returns the number of milliseconds since 1 January, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC, with leap seconds ignored.

### Instance methods

- `Date.prototype.getDate()`:Returns the day of the month (1–31) for the specified date according to local time.

- `Date.prototype.getDay()`:Returns the day of the week (0–6) for the specified date according to local time.

- `Date.prototype.getFullYear()`:Returns the year (4 digits for 4-digit years) of the specified date according to local time.

- `Date.prototype.getHours()`:Returns the hour (0–23) in the specified date according to local time.
