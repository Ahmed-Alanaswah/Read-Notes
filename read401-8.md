# List Comprehensions in Python

## Create a List with range()

Let’s start by creating a list of numbers using Python list comprehensions. We’ll take advantage of Python’s range() method as a way to create a list of digits.

**Example 1: Creating a list with list comprehensions**

```
# construct a basic list using range() and list comprehensions
# syntax
# [ expression for item in list ]
digits = [x for x in range(10)]

print(digits)
```

Let’s break down this python example by starting with the first ‘x’. This is our expression. It doesn’t do anything because we’re simply recording the number. The second ‘x’ represents each item in the list created by the range() method.

In the python example above, we’re using the range() method to generate a list of numbers. Python iterates(or loops) through each item in that range, and saves a copy of the item in a new list called digits.

Perhaps that seems redundant? That’s only because you’ve yet to see the real potential of list comprehension.

## Create a List Using Loops and List Comprehension in Python

To better illustrate how a list comprehension can be used to write more efficient Python code, we’ll take a look at a side by side comparison.

In the following example, you’ll see two different techniques for creating a Python list. The first is a for loop. We’ll use it to construct a list of the powers of two

**Example 2: Comparing list creation methods in Python**

```
# create a list using a for loop
squares = []

for x in range(10):
    # raise x to the power of 2
    squares.append(x**2)

print(squares)
```

The same thing can be done using a list comprehension, but with a fraction of the code. Let’s take a look at how to create a list of squares using the list comprehension method.

```
# create a list using list comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print(squares)
```

## Multiplying Parts of a List

```
# create a list with list comprehensions
multiples_of_three = [ x*3 for x in range(10) ]

print(multiples_of_three)
```

## Show the first letter of each word using Python

```
# a list of the names of popular authors
authors = ["Ernest Hemingway","Langston Hughes","Frank Herbert","Toni Morrison",
    "Emily Dickson","Stephen King"]

# create an acronym from the first letter of the author's names
letters = [ name[0] for name in authors ]
print(letters)
```

## Print numbers only from a given string

```
# user data entered as name and phone number
user_data = "Elvis Presley 987-654-3210"
phone_number = [ x for x in user_data if x.isdigit()]

print(phone_number)
```

## Parsing a file using list comprehension

```
# open the file in read-only mode
file = open("dreams.txt", 'r')
poem = [ line for line in file ]

for line in poem:
    print(line)
```

## Using functions in list comprehensions

```
# list comprehension with functions
# create a function that returns a number doubled
def double(x):
    return x*2

nums = [double(x) for x in range(1,10)]
print(nums)
```
