## images

### controling sizing

You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.

### AligNi ng images

the float property can be used
to move an element to the left or
the right of its containing block,
allowing text to flow around it.

### Centering images

By default, images are inline
elements. This means that they
flow within the surrounding text.
In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel
element using the display
property with a value of block.
Once it has been made into a
block-level element, there are
two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:

1. On the containing element,
   you can use the text-align
   property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can
   use the use the margin property
   and set the values of the left and
   right margins to auto.

### Background Images

- The background-image
  property allows you to place
  an image behind any HTML
  element. This could be the entire
  page or just part of the page. By
  default, a background image will
  repeat to fill the entire box.

- The path to the image follows
  the letters url, and it is put
  inside parentheses and quotes.

### Background Position

- When an image is not being
  repeated, you can use the
  background-position
  property to specify where in the
  browser window the background
  image should be placed.
- This property usually has a pair
  of values. The first represents
  the horizontal position and the
  second represents the vertical.

### background-image

CSS3 is going to introduce the
ability to specify a gradient for
the background of a box. The
gradient is created using the
background-image property
and, at the time of writing,
different browsers required a
different syntax.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.
The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can improve your website's visibility on search engines.

**The Basics Search**
Search engine optimization (or
SEO) is the practice of trying
to help your site appear nearer
the top of search engine results
when people look for the topics
that your website covers.

**On-Page Techniques**
On-page techniques are the
methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their
rating in search engines.

In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability.

1. Page Title
   The page title appears at the top
   of the browser window or on the
   tab of a browser. It is specified in
   the `<title>` element which lives
   inside the `<head> `element.

2. URL / Web Address
   The name of the file is part of
   the URL. Where possible, use
   keywords in the file name.
3. Headings
   If the keywords are in a heading
   `<hn>` element then a search
   engine will know that this page is
   all about that subject and give it
   greater weight than other text.

4. Text
   Where possible, it helps to
   repeat the keywords in the main
   body of the text at least 2-3
   times. Do not, however, over-use
   these terms, because the text
   must be easy for a human to
   read.

5. Link Text
   Use keywords in the text that
   create links between pages
   (rather than using generic
   expressions such as "click here").

6. Image Alt Text
   Search engines rely on you
   providing accurate descriptions
   of images in the alt text. This
   will also help your images show
   up in the results of image-based
   searches.

7. Page Descriptions
   The description also lives inside
   the `<head>` element and is
   specified using a `<meta>` tag.
   It should be a sentence that
   describes the content of the
   page. (These are not shown in
   the browser window but they
   may be displayed in the results
   pages of search engines.)
   Never try to fool search engines!
   They will penalize you for it. For
   example, never add text in the
   same color as the background of
   the page as they can detect this.

**Off-Page Techniques**

- Getting other sites to link to you
  is just as important as on-page
  techniques. Search engines help
  determine how to rank your
  site by looking at the number of
  other sites that link to yours,

- They are particularly interested
  in sites whose content is related
  to yours. For example, if you
  were running a website that
  sold fish bait, then a link from
  a hairdresser is not likely to be
  considered as relevant as one
  from an angling community

### How to Identify Keywords and Phrases

1. **_Brainstorm_**
   List down the words that
   someone might type into
   Google to find your site. Be sure
   to include the various topics,
   products or services your site is
   about.

2. **_Organize_**
   Group the keywords into
   separate lists for the different
   sections or categories of your
   website.

3. **_Research_**
   There are several tools that let
   you enter your keywords and
   then they will suggest additional
   keywords you might like to
   consider, such as:
   adwords.google.co.uk/
   select/KeywordToolExternal
   (When using this tool, select the
   "exact match" option rather than
   "broad match.")
   www.wordtracker.com
   www.keyworddiscovery.com

4. **_Compare_**
   It is very unlikely that your
   site will appear at the top of
   the search results for every
   keyword. This is especially true
   for topics where there is a lot
   of competition. The more sites
   out there that have already been
   optimized for a given keyword,
   the harder it will be for you to
   rise up the search results when
   people search on that term.

5. **_Refine_**
   Now you need to pick which
   keywords you will focus on.
   These should always be the ones
   that are most relevant to each
   section of your site.

6. **_Map_**
   Now that you have a refined list
   of keywords, you know which
   have the most competition, and
   which ones are most relevant,
   it is time to start picking which
   keywords you will use for each
   page.

### Analytics: Learning about your Visitors

**_As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by
Google called Google Analytics._**

**_Signing Up_**
The Google Analytics service
relies on you signing up for an
account at:
www.google.com/analytics
The site will give you a piece of
tracking code which you need to
put on every page of your site.

**_How it Works_**
Every time someone loads a
page of your site, the tracking
code sends data to the Google
servers where it is stored.
Google then provides a webbased
interface that allows you
to see how visitors use your site.

**The Tracking Code**
A tracking code is provided
by Google Analytics for each
website you are tracking. It
should appear just before the
closing `</head>` tag. The code
does not alter the appearance of
your web pages.

### How Many People Are Coming to Your Site?

The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are
likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are
coming to your site.

- **Visits**
  This is the number of times
  people have come to your site. If
  someone is inactive on your site
  for 30 minutes and then looks at
  another page on your site, it will
  be counted as a new visit.

- **Unique Visits**
  This is the total number of
  people who have visited your site
  over the specified period. The
  number of unique visits will be
  lower than the number of visits
  if people have been returning to
  your site more than once in the
  defined period.

* **Page Views**
  The total number of pages all
  visitors have viewed on your site.

* **Pages per Visit**
  The average number of pages
  each visitor has looked at on
  your site per visit
* **Av erage Time on Site**
  The average amount of time
  each user has spent on the site
  per visit.

* **Date Selector**
  Using the date selector in the top
  right hand corner of the site, you
  can change the period of time
  the reports display. When you
  log in, this is usually set to the
  last month, but you can change
  it to report on a specific time
  period.

* **Export**
  The export link just above the
  title that says "visitors overview"
  allows you to export the
  statistics on this page for other
  applications such as Excel

### Domain Names & Hosting

- In order to put your site on the web you will
  need a domain name and web hosting.

- Your domain name is your web
  address (e.g. google.com or bbc.
  co.uk). There are many websites
  that allow you to register domain
  names. Usually you will have to
  pay an annual fee to keep that
  domain name.

- So that other people can see
  your site, you will need to upload
  it to a web server. Web servers
  are special computers that are
  constantly connected to the
  Internet. They are specially set
  up to serve web pages when
  they are requested.
