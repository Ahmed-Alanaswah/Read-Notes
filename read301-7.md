# REST

## Roy Fielding

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

## HOW THE WEB WORK

it's all pretty amazing really. And the funny thing is that it's all very undervalued. The protocol I mentioned, that he helped write, HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason.

## “http” like the beginning of what I type into the browser?

- That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.
- Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.
- For anything really. That guy, Roy Fielding, he talks a lot about what those things point to in that research I was talking about. The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

## URLs

Those URLs tell the browser that there's a concept, somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

## how do the machines tell each other where things are?

Ah! With a URL. If everything that machines need to talk about has a corresponding URL, you've created the machine equivalent of a noun. That you and I and the rest of the world have agreed on talking about nouns in a certain way is pretty important, eh?

Machines don't have a universal noun - that's why they suck. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns. That's why the URL is so important. It let's all of these systems tell each other about each other's nouns.

## HTTP

this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
Web pages usually have images, right? Those are separate resources. The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL.

**_Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like._**
