## MySQL Community Edition

MySQL database is very popular open-source database. It is generally been stacked with apache and PHP, although it can be also stacked with nginx and server side javascripting using Node js. The following are some of MySQL benefits and strengths:

- Replication: By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application

* Sharding: MySQL sharding os useful when there is large no of write operations in a high traffic website. By sharding MySQL servers, the application is partitioned into multiple servers dividing the database into small chunks. As low cost servers can be deployed for this purpose, this is cost effective.
* Memcached as a NoSQL API to MySQL: Memcached can be used to increase the performance of the data retrieval operations giving an advantage of NoSQL api to MySQL server.

# NoSQL Database Examples

1. ## MongoDB
   **Mongodb** is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++ and is currently being used by some big companies like The New York Times, Craigslist, MTV Networks. The following are some of MongoDB benefits and strengths:

- Speed: For simple queries, it gives good performance, as all the related data are in single document which eliminates the join operations.

* nScalability: It is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers in your resource pool instead of relying on a stand alone resource.

* Manageable: It is easy to use for both developers and administrators. This also gives the ability to shard database
* Dynamic Schema: Its gives you the flexibility to evolve your data schema without modifying the existing data

## Hooks

React Router ships with a few hooks that let you access the state of the router and perform navigation from inside your components.Please note: You need to be using React >= 16.8 in order to use any of these hooks!

- useHistory
- useLocation
- useParams
- useRouteMatch

## useHistory

The useHistory hook gives you access to the history instance that you may use to navigate.

## useLocation

The useLocation hook returns the location object that represents the current URL. You can think about it like a useState that returns a new location whenever the URL changes.This could be really useful e.g. in a situation where you would like to trigger a new “page view” event using your web analytics tool whenever a new page loads, as in the following example:

## useParams

useParams returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters. Use it to access match.params of the current `<Route>`.

## useRouteMatch

The useRouteMatch hook attempts to match the current URL in the same way that a `<Route>` would. It’s mostly useful for getting access to the match data without actually rendering a `<Route>`.

## <BrowserRouter>

A <`Router>` that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL
**basename: string**
The base URL for all locations. If your app is served from a sub-directory on your server, you’ll want to set this to the sub-directory. A properly formatted basename should have a leading slash, but no trailing slash

## <HashRouter>

A <Router> that uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Hash history does not support location.key or location.state. In previous versions we attempted to shim the behavior but there were edge-cases we couldn’t solve. Any code or plugin that needs this behavior won’t work. As this technique is only intended to support legacy browsers, we encourage you to configure your server to work with <BrowserHistory> instead.
