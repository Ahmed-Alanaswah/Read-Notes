# docker

* With Docker it doesn't matter if you are using a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer anymore.

* With Docker we now no longer have to mess around with virtual environments. We can faithfully reproduce a production environment locally. And Docker can be shared among team members so everyone is working on the same setup. Wins all around.


## Library Website and API

* Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs. We cannot build a web API with only Django Rest Framework; it always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured.

* To avoid confusion, some developers will call an API views file apiviews.py or api.py. Personally, when working within a dedicated api app I do not find it confusing to just call a Django REST Framework views file views.py but opinion varies on this point


## Serializers
A serializer translates data into a format that is easy to consume over the internet, typically JSON, and is displayed at an API endpoint. We will also cover serializers and JSON in more depth in following chapters. For now I want to demonstrate how easy it is to create a serializer with Django REST Framework to convert Django models to JSON.

## Browsable API
With the local server still running in the first command line console, navigate to our API endpoint in the web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/.
