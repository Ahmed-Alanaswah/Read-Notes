## What Is Node.js?

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

## Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

**The V8 engine** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

However, when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

## Node Binaries vs Version Manager

Many websites will recommend that you head to the official Node download page and grab the Node binaries for your system. While that works, I would suggest that you use a version manager instead. This is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will. There are various advantages to using a version manager. For example, it negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and lets you set a Node version on a per-project basis.

## Node.js Has Excellent Support for Modern JavaScript

As can be seen on this compatibility table, Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.

## Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager

As I mentioned earlier, Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type npm -v.

In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week. Let’s take a quick look at how we would use npm to install a package.

## What Is Node.js Used For?

Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

We have a wide range of articles covering build tooling on SitePoint. Here’s a short selection of my favorites:

## Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server

Next we come to one of the biggest use cases for Node.js — running JavaScript on the server. This isn’t a new concept, and was first attempted by Netscape way back in 1994. Node.js, however, is the first implementation to gain any real traction, and it provides some unique benefits, compared to traditional languages. Node now plays a critical role in the technology stack of many high-profile companies. Let’s have a look at what those benefits are.

## What Kind of Apps Is Node.js Suited To?

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database), or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded. If this real-time aspect of Node is something you’d like to look into more, check out our tutorial on Building a Real-time Chat App.

Yet saying this, not everyone is going to be building the next Trello or the next Google Docs, and really, there’s no reason that you can’t use Node to build a simple CRUD app. However, if you follow this route, you’ll soon find out that Node is pretty bare-bones and that the way you build and structure the app is left very much up to you. There are various frameworks you can use to reduce the boilerplate, with Express having established itself as the front runner. Yet even a solution such as Express is minimal, meaning that if you want to do anything slightly out of the ordinary, you’ll need to pull in additional modules from npm. This is in stark contrast to frameworks such as Rails or Laravel, which come with a lot of functionality out of the box.

## What Are the Advantages of Node.js?

Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server — as well as in the browser — is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes. You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive (and hopefully, happier). For example, you can easily share code between the server and the client.

Another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB). JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JavaScript program, meaning that when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.

Finally, JavaScript is ubiquitous: most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point. This means that transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages. To quote Craig Buckler in his Node vs PHP Smackdown, JavaScript might remain the world’s most misunderstood language — but, once the concepts click, it makes other languages seem cumbersome.
