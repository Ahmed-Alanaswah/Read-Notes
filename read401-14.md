# Matplotlib

## Introduction

matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.

## IPython

is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more. It allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.

## pyplot

pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM). Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.

### Simple plot

In this section, we want to draw the cosine and sine functions on the same plot. Starting from the default settings, we'll enrich the figure step by step to make it nicer.

The first step is to get the data for the sine and cosine functions:

```
import numpy as np

X = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 256, endpoint=True)
C, S = np.cos(X), np.sin(X)
```

X is now a NumPy array with 256 values ranging from -π to +π (included). C is the cosine (256 values) and S is the sine (256 values).

To run the example, you can download each of the examples and run it using:

## Annotate some points

```
t = 2*np.pi/3
plt.plot([t,t],[0,np.cos(t)], color ='blue', linewidth=1.5, linestyle="--")
plt.scatter([t,],[np.cos(t),], 50, color ='blue')

plt.annotate(r'$\sin(\frac{2\pi}{3})=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$',
             xy=(t, np.sin(t)), xycoords='data',
             xytext=(+10, +30), textcoords='offset points', fontsize=16,
             arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="->", connectionstyle="arc3,rad=.2"))

plt.plot([t,t],[0,np.sin(t)], color ='red', linewidth=1.5, linestyle="--")
plt.scatter([t,],[np.sin(t),], 50, color ='red')

plt.annotate(r'$\cos(\frac{2\pi}{3})=-\frac{1}{2}$',
             xy=(t, np.cos(t)), xycoords='data',
             xytext=(-90, -50), textcoords='offset points', fontsize=16,
             arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="->", connectionstyle="arc3,rad=.2"))
```

## Figures, Subplots, Axes and Ticks

### Figures

A figure is the windows in the GUI that has "Figure #" as title. Figures are numbered starting from 1 as opposed to the normal Python way starting from 0. This is clearly MATLAB-style.

### Subplots

With subplot you can arrange plots in a regular grid. You need to specify the number of rows and columns and the number of the plot. Note that the gridspec command is a more powerful alternative.

### Axes

Axes are very similar to subplots but allow placement of plots at any location in the figure. So if we want to put a smaller plot inside a bigger one we do so with axes.

#### Ticks

Well formatted ticks are an important part of publishing-ready figures. Matplotlib provides a totally configurable system for ticks. There are tick locators to specify where ticks should appear and tick formatters to give ticks the appearance you want. Major and minor ticks can be located and formatted independently from each other. By default minor ticks are not shown, i.e. there is only an empty list for them because it is as NullLocator (see below).

### Tick Locators

There are several locators for different kind of requirements:

**IndexLocator**

### Animation

For quite a long time, animation in matplotlib was not an easy task and was done mainly through clever hacks. However, things have started to change since version 1.1 and the introduction of tools for creating animation very intuitively, with the possibility to save them in all kind of formats (but don't expect to be able to run very complex animations at 60 fps though).
Documentation

See Animation
The most easy way to make an animation in matplotlib is to declare a FuncAnimation object that specifies to matplotlib what is the figure to update, what is the update function and what is the delay between frames.

### Drip drop

A very simple rain effect can be obtained by having small growing rings randomly positioned over a figure. Of course, they won't grow forever since the wave is supposed to damp with time. To simulate that, we can use a more and more transparent color as the ring is growing, up to the point where it is no more visible. At this point, we remove the ring and create a new one.

First step is to create a blank figu

```
# New figure with white background
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6,6), facecolor='white')

# New axis over the whole figure, no frame and a 1:1 aspect ratio
ax = fig.add_axes([0,0,1,1], frameon=False, aspect=1)
```

Next, we need to create several rings. For this, we can use the scatter plot object that is generally used to visualize points cloud, but we can also use it to draw rings by specifying we don't have a facecolor. We also have to take care of initial size and color for each ring such that we have all sizes between a minimum and a maximum size. In addition, we need to make sure the largest ring is almost transparent.

![](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial/raw/master/figures/rain-static.png)

```
# Number of ring

n = 50
size_min = 50
size_max = 50\*50

# Ring position

P = np.random.uniform(0,1,(n,2))

# Ring colors

C = np.ones((n,4)) \* (0,0,0,1)

# Alpha color channel goes from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque)

C[:,3] = np.linspace(0,1,n)

# Ring sizes

S = np.linspace(size_min, size_max, n)

# Scatter plot

scat = ax.scatter(P[:,0], P[:,1], s=S, lw = 0.5,
edgecolors = C, facecolors='None')

# Ensure limits are [0,1] and remove ticks

ax.set_xlim(0,1), ax.set_xticks([])
ax.set_ylim(0,1), ax.set_yticks([])
```

```
def update(frame):
    global P, C, S

    # Every ring is made more transparent
    C[:,3] = np.maximum(0, C[:,3] - 1.0/n)

    # Each ring is made larger
    S += (size_max - size_min) / n

    # Reset ring specific ring (relative to frame number)
    i = frame % 50
    P[i] = np.random.uniform(0,1,2)
    S[i] = size_min
    C[i,3] = 1

    # Update scatter object
    scat.set_edgecolors(C)
    scat.set_sizes(S)
    scat.set_offsets(P)

    # Return the modified object
    return scat,
```
