# React context 

* React context is an essential tool for every React developer to know. I lets you easily share state in your applications.

* In this comprehensive guide, we will cover what React context is, how to use it, when and when not to use context, and lots more.

* Even if you've never worked with React context before, you're in the right place. You will learn everything you need to know with simple, step-by-step examples.



* React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.


## When should you use React context?

React context is great when you are passing data that can 
be used in any component in your application.


### These types of data include:

1. Theme data (like dark or light mode)
2. User data (the currently authenticated user)
3. Location-specific data (like user language or locale)


Data should be placed on React context that does not need to be updated often.

Why? Because context was not made as an entire state management system. It was made to make consuming data easier.

### What problems does React context solve?

React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.


### How do I use React context?
 we can create and use context directly by importing React in any React project.


### There are four steps to using React context:

1. Create context using the createContext method.
2. Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.
3. Put any value you like on your context provider using the value prop.
4. Read that value within any component by using the context consumer.


```
import React from 'react';

export const UserContext = React.createContext();

export default function App() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value="Reed">
      <User />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  )
}

function User() {
  return (
    <UserContext.Consumer>
      {value => <h1>{value}</h1>} 
      {/* prints: Reed */}
    </UserContext.Consumer>
  )
}
```
