# LIST 
**we have 2 type of lists in html:**
* The ordered list is created with
the `<ol>` element.

* The unordered list is created with the `<ul>` element.

* Each item in the list is placed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag. (The li stands for list item.)

## BOXES

### border ,margin,padding

* **border:** Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another. 

* **margin:** Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes. 

* **padding:** Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.

* Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
