# How to run Linear regression in Python scikit-Learn

you know that linear regression is a popular technique and you might as well seen the mathematical equation of linear regression. But do you know how to implement a linear regression in Python?? If so donâ€™t read this post because this post is all about implementing linear regression in Python. There are several ways in which you can do that, you can do linear regression using numpy, scipy, stats model and sckit learn. But in this post I am going to use scikit learn to perform linear regression.

## Exploring Boston Housing Data Set

The first step is to import the required Python libraries into Ipython Notebook.

![](https://bigdata-madesimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Explore-1.png)

This data set is available in sklearn Python module, so I will access it using scikitlearn. I am going to import Boston data set into Ipython notebook and store it in a variable called boston.

The object boston is a dictionary, so you can explore the keys of this dictionary.

I will see the description of this data set to know more about it. In this data set I have 506 instances(rows) and 13 attributes or parameters(columns). The goal of this exercise is to predict the housing prices in boston region using the features given.

As you can see the column names are just numbers, so I am going to replace those numbers with the feature names.

## Fitting a Linear Model

I am going to use all 13 parameters to fit a linear regression model. Two other parameters that you can pass to linear regression object are fit_intercept and normalize.

In [20]: lm.fit(X, bos.PRICE)

Out[20]: LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, normalize=False)

I am going to print the intercept and number of coefficients.

I then construct a data frame that contains features and estimated coefficients

As you can see from the data frame that there is a high correlation between RM and prices. Lets plot a scatter plot between True housing prices and True RM.

As you can see that there is a positive correlation between RM and housing prices.

Predicting Prices
I am going to calculate the predicted prices (Y^i) using lm.predict. Then I display the first 5 housing prices. These are my predicted housing prices.

Then I plot a scatter plot to compare true prices and the predicted prices.

## Training and validation data sets

In practice you wont implement linear regression on the entire data set, you will have to split the data sets into training and test data sets. So that you train your model on training data and see how well it performed on test data.

## How to do train-test split:

You have to divide your data sets randomly. Scikit learn provides a function called train_test_split to do this.

## Residual Plots
