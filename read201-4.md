# HTML & CSS
## LINKS 

## Writing Links
Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything
between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

### balnk
If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening `<a>` tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.

## LAYOUT
### BUILDING BLOCKS
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

**Block-level elements**
start on a new line
Examples include:
`<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`

**flow in between**
surrounding text
Examples include:
`<img> <b> <i>`

## Containing Elements

If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

### Controll ing the Position of El ements
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

* Normal flow
* Relative Positioning 
* Ab solute positioning

## Screen Sizes

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.

## Layout Grids 
Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements — how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

## CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

# JavaScript

## FUNCTION 
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

### Function declarations
```
function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}
```

### Function expressions 

``` 
const square = function(number) { return number * number }
var x = square(4) // x gets the value 16
```
