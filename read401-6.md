# How to use the Random Module in Python

n this post, I would like to describe the usage of the random module in Python. The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.

import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

Overview
In this post, I would like to describe the usage of the random module in Python. The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

When to use it?
We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc. When making your password database more secure or powering a random page feature of your website.

Random functions
The Random module contains some very useful functions.

Randint
If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.

### Random

If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

For example, a random number between 0 and 100:

import random
random.random() \* 100

### Choice

Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

random.choice( ['red', 'black', 'green'] ).
The choice function can often be used for choosing a random element from a list.

import random
myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)

### Shuffle

The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
Output:

print x gives [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]

of course your results will vary

### Randrange

Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

random.randrange(start, stop[, step])
import random
for i in range(3):
print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)

'''

import random
import itertools

outcomes = { 'heads':0,
'tails':0,
}
sides = outcomes.keys()

for i in range(10000):
outcomes[ random.choice(sides) ] += 1

print "Heads:", outcomes['heads']
print "Tails:", outcomes['tails']
There are only two outcomes allowed, so rather than use numbers and convert them, the words “heads” and “tails” are used with choice().

The results are tabulated in a dictionary using the outcome names as keys.

$ python random_choice.py

Heads: 4984
Tails: 5016

## What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

## Why use Risk Analysis?

In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.
Now, you might think what could be the possible risks that you could encounter? Well here is a list:

1. Use of new hardware
2. Use of new technology
3. Use of new automation tool
4. The sequence of code
5. Availability of test resources for the application

Now, you must know there are certain risks that are unavoidable. I am enumerating them below:

1. The time that you allocated for testing

2. A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application

3. Urgency from the clients to deliver the project

4. Incomplete requirements

In such cases, you have to tackle the situation with care. Following points can be taken care of:

- Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting

- Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas

- Create a Risk Assessment database for future use

- Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.

Now, what are these risk magnitude indicators? Well, here is an explanation.

**High**: means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable. The company might face loss.

**Medium**: it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.

**Low**: it is tolerable. There lies little or no external exposure or no financial loss.

### Risk Identification

There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process. Those are as follows:

1. Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic. It is the risk that may come from your company or your customer, not from your project.

2. Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used.

3. Premature Release Risk: a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required

4. Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.

### Risk Assessment

In the risk analysis process, these steps prove to be the most important one. It is said that this step is way too complex and should be tackled with the utmost care. After risk identification, assessment has to be dealt programmatically. There are a few perspectives on risk assessment. Read on!

### The perspective of Risk Assessment

There are three perspectives of Risk Assessment:

- Effect

- Cause

- Likelihood

**Effect** – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

**Cause** – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

**Likelihood** – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.

## How to perform Risk Analysis?

1. Searching the risk

2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

3. Measures for the risk identified

## Dependency Injection

### Why should I uLet’s say we have a car class which contains various objects such as wheels, engine, etc.

Here the car class is responsible for creating all the dependency objects. Now, what if we decide to ditch MRFWheels in the future and want to use Yokohama Wheels?

We will need to recreate the car object with a new Yokohama dependency. But when using dependency injection (DI), we can change the Wheels at runtime (because dependencies can be injected at runtime rather than at compile time).

You can think of DI as the middleman in our code who does all the work of creating the preferred wheels object and providing it to the Car class.

It makes our Car class independent from creating the objects of Wheels, Battery, etc.se dependency injection?

### There are basically three types of dependency injection:

1. constructor injection: the dependencies are provided through a class constructor.
2. setter injection: the client exposes a setter method that the injector uses to inject the dependency.
3. interface injection: the dependency provides an injector method that will inject the dependency into any client passed to it. Clients must implement an interface that exposes a setter method that accepts the dependency.

So now its the dependency injection’s responsibility to:

1. Create the objects
2. Know which classes require those objects
3. And provide them all those objects

## Inversion of control —the concept behind DI

This states that a class should not configure its dependencies statically but should be configured by some other class from outside.

It is the fifth principle of S.O.L.I.D — the five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design by Uncle Bob — which states that a class should depend on abstraction and not upon concretions (in simple terms, hard-coded).

According to the principles, a class should concentrate on fulfilling its responsibilities and not on creating objects that it requires to fulfill those responsibilities. And that’s where dependency injection comes into play: it provides the class with the required objects.

### Benefits of using DI

1. Helps in Unit testing.
2. Boiler plate code is reduced, as initializing of dependencies is done by the injector component.
3. Extending the application becomes easier.
4. Helps to enable loose coupling, which is important in application programming.

### Disadvantages of DI

1. It’s a bit complex to learn, and if overused can lead to management issues and other problems.
2. Many compile time errors are pushed to run-time.
3. Dependency injection frameworks are implemented with reflection or dynamic programming. This can hinder use of IDE automation, such as “find references”, “show call hierarchy” and safe refactoring.

### Libraries and Frameworks that implement DI

- Spring (Java)
- Google Guice (Java)
- Dagger (Java and Android)
- Castle Windsor (.NET)
- Unity(.NET)
