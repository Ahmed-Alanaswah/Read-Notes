# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## TEXT

* Headings and paragraphs.
* Bold, italic, emphasis.
* Structural and semantic markup.

When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.

## HEADING 

HTML has six "levels" of headings:
* `<h1>` is used for main headings
* `<h2>` is used for subheadings

## ParagraphS 

To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening `<p>` tag and closing `</p>` tag.

## Bold & Italic
* By enclosing words in the tags `<b>` and `</b>` we can make characters appear bold.

* By enclosing words in the tags `<i>`and `</i>` we can make characters appear italic.

## Superscript & Subscript

* The `<sup>` element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.

* The `<sub>` element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas.

## Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules

* if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag `<br />`.

* To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections
using the ` <hr /> ` tag.

## Quotations

The `<blockquote>` element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Note how the `<p`> element is still used inside the `<blockquote>` element.

* The `<q>` element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the `<q>` element, however Internet Explorer does not — herefore many people avoid
using the `<q>` element.

## Changes to Content

* The `<ins>` element can be used to show content that has been
inserted into a document, while the `<del>` element can show text
that has been deleted from it.

* The `<s>` element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).

* Visually the content of an `<s>` element will usually be displayed with a line through the center.

## INTRODUCTION TO CSS
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a **selector and a declaration**.

**WE CAN US ETHE CSS IN 3 WAY:**
* external file and put path in link  in a head part.
* inside `<style></style>` .
* inside opening tags directly.

 ## DESICION AND LOOPS

 ### EVALUATION CONDITIONS & CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

![CONDITIONS](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/es6/images/es6-decision-making2.png)

**THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS TO A DECISION:**
1. AN EXPRESSION IS EVALUATED, WITCH RETURNS A VALUE.
2. A CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS SAYS WHAT TO DO  IN GIVEN SITUATION.

## SWITCH STATEMENT
* The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

* Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.
